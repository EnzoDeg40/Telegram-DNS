# Telegram-DNS
At first I wanted to create a dashboard to quickly manage DNS records. Then I thought that going through Telegram commands was much easier.

## Installation 
Create .env file with the following content:
```bash
BOT_TOKEN="telegram_bot_token"
```
## Packages used
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
